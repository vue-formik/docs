    <h1>Why Components?</h1>
    <p>
      Components are the building blocks of a Vue application. They are reusable and can be composed
      to create complex UIs. Components are also self-contained, meaning they have their own state
      and logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this library, we provide a set of components that you can use to build forms. These
      components are designed to work with the
      <code>useFormik</code> composable.
